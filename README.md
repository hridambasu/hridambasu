### More About Me:
- :nerd_face:	Welcome to my homepage! Thanks for stopping by. I have been working as a cryptography research engineer in the blockchain space with stints at industry leaders like Polygon, Aztec, Bolt Labs and so on. My work has been primarily around theoretical and practical aspects of zero-knowledge proofs and secure multiparty computation across multiple domains like privacy-focussed financial applications like confidential transactions, supply chain traceability, crowdsourcing applications on Ethereum, wallets for blockchain gaming, energy IoT systems, etc. I have worked on multiple different zero-knowledge proof systems starting from NIZKs like Groth-Sahai, ZK-SNARKs like Groth16 and PLONK, ZK-STARKs, Recursive SNARKs right upto various Folding schemes like CCS. I have held short positions at prestigious research labs around the world like AT&T Labs New York City and NTT Labs Tokyo. I obtained an M.S. in Computer Science from Northeastern University, Boston, USA and a B.E. in Information Technology from Jadavpur University.
