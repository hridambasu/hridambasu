✨Hi there 👋, this is Hridam Basu✨
</h1>

### More About Me:
I'm **a Cryptography Research Engineer at the Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) team at Ethereum Foundation**, working on privacy-preserving blockchain applications like the **Anon-Aadhaar project**. With extensive experience in cryptographic research and engineering, I’ve worked at leading blockchain companies, including **Polygon (Matic Network), Aztec, Findora, Circularise, and Bolt Labs**.

My expertise spans the **theoretical and practical aspects of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** and **secure multiparty computation (MPC)** across diverse domains such as **privacy-focused financial applications (confidential transactions, private payments), supply chain traceability, crowdsourcing on Ethereum, blockchain gaming wallets, and energy IoT systems**.

I’ve worked on a wide range of **zero-knowledge proof systems**, including **NIZKs (Groth-Sahai), ZK-SNARKs (Groth16, PLONK), ZK-STARKs, Recursive SNARKs, and Folding schemes like CCS**. I also have **cryptographic audit experience on a privacy-focused blockchain using a ZK-STARK-based virtual machine (VM)**, where I assessed proof systems, constraints, and security guarantees. Recently, I’ve done some work in the intersection of **Blockchain and AI**.

Outside of industry roles, I’ve held **research positions at prestigious institutions such as AT&T Labs (New York City), NTT Labs (Tokyo), and TCS Labs**, contributing to advanced cryptographic protocols. I’ve been **invited as a speaker on zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain security** at international conferences, universities, and research institutes worldwide.

I hold an **M.S. in Computer Science from Northeastern University, Boston, USA**, specializing in **Cryptography, Cybersecurity, and Theoretical Computer Science**, and a **B.E. in Information Technology from Jadavpur University, India**.
