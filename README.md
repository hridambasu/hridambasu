## 📢 Course Announcement — January 2026
![Blockchain, Cryptography, ZKP Workshop Poster](./Poster%20-%20Blockchain%20Cryptography.png)
I’m pleased to announce the launch of my upcoming **Certification Programme on Blockchain, Cryptography, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Theory & Applications)** beginning **January 2026**.

This programme is designed for students, developers, engineers, and professionals looking to build strong foundations in modern cryptography, understand ZK architectures, and gain hands-on experience with circuits and proof systems.  
**No prior background is required.**

### 🔍 Highlights
- Cryptography fundamentals, elliptic curves, commitments  
- ZK-SNARKs: Groth16, PLONK, STARKs  
- ZK-Rollups, ZK-VMs, protocol internals  
- Lookup arguments, sum-check, polynomial commitments  
- Build ZK circuits & proof systems from scratch  
- Official Certification  
- **50% student discount**

### 🗓 Starts: January 2026

## More About Me:
I'm the Founder of [Rump Labs](https://www.rumplabs.xyz/).  Previously I was **a Cryptography Research Engineer Grantee at the Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) team at Ethereum Foundation**, having worked on privacy-preserving blockchain applications like the **Anon-Aadhaar project**. With extensive experience in cryptographic research and engineering, I’ve worked at leading blockchain companies, including **Polygon (Matic Network), Aztec, Findora, Circularise, and Bolt Labs**.

My expertise spans the **theoretical and practical aspects of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** and **secure multiparty computation (MPC)** across diverse domains such as **privacy-focused financial applications (confidential transactions, private payments), supply chain traceability, crowdsourcing on Ethereum, blockchain gaming wallets, and energy IoT systems**.

I’ve worked on a wide range of **zero-knowledge proof systems**, including **NIZKs (Groth-Sahai), ZK-SNARKs (Groth16, PLONK), ZK-STARKs, Recursive SNARKs, and Folding schemes like CCS**. I also have **cryptographic audit experience on a privacy-focused blockchain (Neptune Cash) using a ZK-STARK-based virtual machine (VM) called Triton VM**, where I assessed proof systems, constraints, and security guarantees ([Audit Report](https://neptune.cash/blog/betanet-v2/triton-vm-audit-hridam-basu.pdf)). Recently, I’ve done some work in the intersection of **Blockchain and AI**.

Outside of industry roles, I’ve held **research positions at prestigious institutions such as AT&T Labs (New York City), NTT Labs (Tokyo), and TCS Labs**, contributing to advanced cryptographic protocols. I’ve been **invited as a speaker on zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain security** at international conferences, universities, and research institutes worldwide.

I hold an **M.S. in Computer Science from Northeastern University, Boston, USA**, specializing in **Cryptography, Cybersecurity, and Theoretical Computer Science**, and a **B.E. in Information Technology from Jadavpur University, India**.
